# HW08- Making a shiny app


## Welcome to my 8th homework assignment. 

For this assignment I used the BC Liquor app as a template. The code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).

For this assignment I had to add three features to this app then deploy it. My app can be found [at this link](https://katiezinn.shinyapps.io/HW08_KatieZinn/). Additionally, my raw R code can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-katiezinn/blob/master/app.R). I put comments next to the changes I made so you can tell where I added the features in.

## **The features I added to the app are as follows:**

1) Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI. :heavy_check_mark:
2) Experiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny, I used shinythemes. :heavy_check_mark:
3) Allow the user to search for multiple alcohol types simultaneously, instead of being able to choose only wines/beers/etc. :heavy_check_mark:
4) Additionally, I used the DT package to create an interactive table for the search results. :heavy_check_mark:

## **I also met the following expecations:**

1) There’s at least one new functional widget that modifies at least one output. :heavy_check_mark:
2) There’s at least one change the ui (aside from the addition of a widget). :heavy_check_mark:

Cheers,
Katie
